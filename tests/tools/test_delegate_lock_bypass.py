"""Tests for delegate_tool lock discipline in _active_children tracking.

Both _build_child_agent (append) and _run_single_child's finally block
(remove) must always hold _active_children_lock when mutating
_active_children.  The current code has an unlocked fallback branch
that runs when the lock is None, bypassing thread-safety.
