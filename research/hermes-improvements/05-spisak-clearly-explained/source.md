Alright lets dive in...

## 1. What Hermes Agent Actually Is (30-Second Version)

Hermes is a personal automation agent that lives on a server (or laptop) and talks to you through messaging apps (or my personal favority... the CLI). It's an always-on system that handles recurring jobs, monitors things you care about, auto-learns, and creates reusable skills for you.

Install it with one command. Connect it to Telegram. Give it a job. It runs 24/7 on a cheap VPS or your personal device. The best part is it monitors in the background  and wakes on demand. You message it whenever you need something and it keeps track of what is already in flight.

The install takes 2 minutes:

- curl the install script
- run `hermes` pick a model with `hermes model`
- connect Telegram with `hermes gateway setup`
That's it. You have an agent.

## 2. The Learning Loop (This Is the Whole Point)

Every 15 or so tool calls, Hermes pauses. It looks at what just happened. What worked. What failed. What took too long. Then it writes a skill - a markdown file saved to ~/.hermes/skills/ that turns what it learned into a reusable workflow.

These aren't hidden. You can open them. Read them. Edit them. Delete the ones it got wrong.

Here's the practical difference. Ask Hermes to research a topic on day one and you get a generic summary. Ask it the same thing on day 30 and the output is tighter, more relevant, and formatted the way you actually want it. It learned your preferences from watching what you respond to and what you ignore.

Claude Code's memory stores facts about your preferences. Hermes stores executable procedures. It doesn't just remember that you like bullet points. It remembers the entire research-filter-format workflow that produces bullet points the way you want them.

## 3. How It's Different From Claude Code and OpenClaw

Claude Code lives in your repo. It reads your codebase, writes code, runs tests, commits. One of the best coding agent available (I still like codex for true development). But it doesn't live on a server. It doesn't message you on Telegram. It doesn't run recurring jobs while you sleep.

OpenClaw lives on your server. It's a personal agent with messaging, scheduling, and tool access. But it doesn't have a learning loop. It doesn't write its own skills from experience.

Hermes lives on your server like OpenClaw, but adds the learning loop. Every task makes it marginally better at the next one. And if you're coming from OpenClaw, one command imports everything - your persona, memories, skills, API keys, and messaging settings. Run `hermes claw migrate` and you're done in five minutes.

Here's the take nobody wants to hear. Stop comparing them. Run Claude Code for software development. Run Hermes for everything else. They share the same MCP protocol, so your tools work in both. That's the architecture.

## 4. Morning Briefings That Learn What You Care About

One builder bought a Mac Mini M4 to run local LLMs. Wasn't powerful enough. So he repurposed it as a home server running Hermes with a Telegram bot. It now handles his job search pipeline, dev project tracking, and daily briefings. He stopped opening his laptop to check email first thing in the morning.

The setup: connect Hermes to Telegram with `hermes gateway setup`. Tell it to monitor your email, calendar, and 2-3 topics. Schedule it as a recurring task. Every morning, a summary lands in your Telegram.

Hermes supports 15+ messaging platforms - Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Email, even Home Assistant. Pick the one you check first.

The benefit isn't the briefing itself. It's what happens after two weeks. Hermes learns which email senders you respond to, which meetings you prep for, and which topics make you ask follow-ups. The skill file updates itself. Your briefing on day 30 looks nothing like day one.

## 5. Web Monitoring That Replaces Manual Review Queues

One builder set up Hermes to review incoming user reports on a live site and decide whether metadata should be corrected. It replaced a manual review process entirely. The agent reads the report, checks it against the existing data, applies the fix if it's valid, and logs what it changed.

Hermes ships with Camoufox - a stealth browser that doesn't fingerprint like normal automation tools. Sites that block headless browsers run clean. Pair it with Firecrawl for structured extraction and you have a monitoring pipeline that doesn't get detected.

Point it at competitor pricing pages, job boards, news sources, product listings. Hermes handles extraction, change tracking, and knows what's new versus what it already showed you yesterday. Setup once, let it run on schedule.

The benefit: you stop manually checking 10 tabs every morning and start getting a diff of what actually changed overnight.

## 6. One Agent Running an Entire Company

A fintech founder tried the multi-agent approach. Five specialized AI agents - marketing, sales development, engineering, community, and daily briefings. Each with its own identity, memory, and schedule.

It failed in 48 hours. The agents couldn't share context. Skills duplicated across systems. The brand voice was inconsistent between channels because each agent had different instructions.

He collapsed everything into one Hermes instance. Claude Code handles the codebase. One agent runs marketing, outreach, community management, and daily briefings for a zero-employee fintech startup. Marketing context is available when doing outreach because it's the same agent that handled both.

The benefit: unified memory means every function feeds context into every other function. That compounding doesn't happen when you split work across 5 disconnected tools.

## 7. Build a Knowledge Base That Gets Smarter Over Time

Hermes ships with Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern as a built-in skill. You tell it to create a wiki, point it at sources, and it organizes everything into interlinked markdown files. Summaries, entity pages, concept pages, comparisons - all cross-referenced and maintained by the agent.

I wrote a full setup guide for this pattern:

The wiki has three layers. Raw sources go in and never get modified. The agent writes and maintains wiki pages from those sources. A schema file defines the rules so everything stays consistent.

Here's why this matters for Hermes specifically. The learning loop means the wiki gets maintained automatically. Add a new source and the agent doesn't just file it. It checks existing pages, updates anything that changed, adds cross-references, and flags contradictions. After a month of regular use, you have a compounding knowledge base that synthesizes everything you've fed it.

643 community skills are available in the Skills Hub if you want to extend this further. Browse them with /skills inside Hermes.

## 8. Run Experiments That Optimize Themselves

The autoresearch pattern works like this: an AI agent makes a small change to something, tests whether it worked, keeps the winner, and tries again. Over and over. Automatically.

I wrote about this pattern and 10 practical business applications:

Hermes is built for this kind of loop. Give it a metric you want to improve - email open rates, landing page conversion, response time to leads. Tell it to make small changes, measure the result, and keep what works. The learning loop means it doesn't just test randomly. It gets better at predicting which changes will work based on what it's already tried.

One builder gave Hermes a brokerage API key and built 4 automated trading strategies. Deployed them to a live account. Another runs an automated token operation on Solana autonomously. These aren't demos. These are production systems handling real money.

The benefit: you define the goal and the constraints. Hermes runs the experiments while you do other things.

## 9. Connect to Your Claude Code MCP Servers (Zero Migration)

Hermes v0.8.0 shipped native MCP client support. MCP is the same protocol Claude Code uses for tool integrations.

Every MCP server you've already built or installed for Claude Code works with Hermes. Your Google Workspace connector, your database tools, your custom APIs. Hermes discovers them automatically. No rebuilding. No reconfiguring.

I run both agents. Claude Code writes my code and manages repos. Hermes handles research, briefings, monitoring, and automation using the same MCP servers I already had configured. One infrastructure investment, two agents, zero duplication.

The benefit: your tools don't care which agent is calling them. Build your MCP layer once and both agents use it.

## 10. Pick the Right Model (Or Waste Your First Weekend)

The wrong model choice is the #1 reason Hermes setups feel broken. People blame the framework when it's the model failing at tool calling.

One builder ran Hermes on a project for almost 3 hours continuously after the v0.8.0 update - but only after switching to a frontier model. Others have tried large open-source models and watched the agent hallucinate tool calls that don't exist. Gemma 4 26B via Ollama is the best current option for local experiments, but for the workflows in this article, use a frontier model API.

Switch with `hermes model`. Nous Portal, OpenRouter with 200+ models, OpenAI, or your own endpoint. No code changes, no lock-in. Run `hermes doctor` if something feels off - it diagnoses configuration issues before you spend hours guessing.

The benefit: the right model turns every workflow above from "interesting experiment" to "production system I rely on."

That's Hermes Agent. What it is, how it works, and 7 workflows real people are running right now. 50K stars in two months because the learning loop changes what "automation" means. Every workflow you set up gets marginally better over time. That compounds.

Install it. Connect Telegram. Give it one recurring job. Let it run for two weeks before judging. The day 30 version of your agent is the one worth evaluating.
